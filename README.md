# Nuts2json

Nuts2json supports the design of web maps with Eurostat data. It provides various reusable versions of Eurostat NUTS dataset as web formats such as <a href="http://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/topojson">TopoJSON</a>. In a way, it is a blank map of NUTS geometries ready for use with your own data and colors.
